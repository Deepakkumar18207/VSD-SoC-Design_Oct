Routing â€“ to connect the cells. Hori/vert metal straps, Min IR drop, to address electromigration. High level metal is thick for reducing the Resistance. Matal layers are defined in PDK , thickness, height etc.

RTL-GS flow
1. Spec: application spec IC, Cost of chip  , constraints, functionality , area, clock
2. Arch design: Block diag. eg ALU, memory, cost ect.
3.RTL Eng: wite functional or behavioural code in VHDl or Verilog
4. Logic synthesis: a) translate: High level RTL to logic gate level without changing the functionality, b) Tech mapping: 28nm,14nm, c) optimization: in terms of power, afrea best QOR.
5 Logic verification and testing (DFT): logic validation, if not pass it to step 4 
6. PHSICAL Design: ICC2 synopsys, ANOS cadence. It takes the gate level net list + SCD constraints file as an input . works on transistors level, CMOS etc. Now transistor level GDS format file sent to verification and sign off.
7 Phsical verification and sign off: DRC, LVS; CROSS TALK; POWER; TIMING: ETC:
8. Fabrication : GDS to fab lab
9: Packaging: testing the IC , bug free and packaging
10. IC : to matket.

Harden means: to generate the final layout
Automation: Puch button -write flow and then execute
Interaction: Steo by step.

Yosys Translates RTL to logic ck tusking the generated components.
Ckt also gets optimized using the abc script with synthesized strategies for getting best timing .
Design exp utility to design the config.  in best way to result in clean layout.

If metal wiring long enough, it acts as antenna, aborb charges, then it problem comes under picture. It is a job of router to handle the wiring length etc. if routers fails to predict the problem then following solutions are there:
